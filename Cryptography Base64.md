# Cryptography Compilation
This is a compilation of easy cryptography challenges from CTFlearn.<br>

## Character Encoding
Challenge link: [CTFlearn](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/115)<br>

In this challenge, i was given a list of hex characters, which is <br>41 42 43 54 46 7B 34 35 43 31 31 5F 31 35 5F 55 35 33 46 55 4C 7D.<br> In here, i use [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), but you can just search hexcode to ascii and It'll work just fine.

## Base64
Challenge link: [CTFlearn](Q1RGe0ZsYWdneVdhZ2d5UmFnZ3l9)<br>

In this challenge, i was given a string that is encoded in Base64, which <br>is Q1RGe0ZsYWdneVdhZ2d5UmFnZ3l9. Once again, <br>just put that in a Base64 decoder in cyberchef and that's it.

## Morse Code
Challenge link: [CTFlearn](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/309)<br>

In this challenge, i was given a string of morse code, which is <br>
"
..-. .-.. .- --. ... .- -- ..- . .-.. -- --- .-. ... . .. <br>... -.-. --- --- .-.. -... -.-- - .... . .-- .- -.--<br> .. .-.. .. -.- . -.-. .... . . ...
". And yes, just search a<br>
converter in cyberchef and that's it.

## Binary String
Challenge link: [CTFlearn](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/230)<br>

In this challenge, i was given a string of binary data, which is<br>
"01000011010101000100011001111011010000100110100101110100010111110100011001101100011010010111000001110000011010010110111001111101".<br>
Once again, just put it in binary converter in cyberchef and that's it.<br>
If you still cant find it, try changing the byte length (8 is the standard length).<br>
