# Package USE flags
These are my per package USE flags. Some are autogenerated by portage, and some are configured by me.<br>
This can either be a folder, or a file.<br>

For networkmanager, i choose iwd simply because wpa_suppliant doesnt detect my home wifi, and its superior anyway.<br>
I may add more depending on my needs, but this is enough for me right now.
